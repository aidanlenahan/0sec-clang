# 0sec-clang
Efficiently and swiftly compiles C code with basic naming scheme.

# HOW IT WORKS
Instead of typing out "clang script.c -o script", this can be run instead: "0c script", which does the exact same thing, while making your programming process much more efficient!
This program relies on "clang", so before running "0c", install it with "apt install clang -y".

# INSTALL
copy this command

git clone https://github.com/aidanlenahan/0sec-clang && cd 0sec-clang && chmod +x ./setup.sh && ./setup.sh
